Calculating values in the sacrifice_summary.json

sacrifice_summary.json files have a summary of the
estimated sacrifice and uncertainties of events due to
the data cleaning cut bifurcation branch (cut1) and the
classifiers (cut2).  To calculate the entries in the 
"sacrifice_summary.json" related to a variable 
to a variable (energy, for this example):

1. Get fully processed dataset of interest.  ntuples 
are preferred, as they will be faster to search and have
data cleaning cut information.

2. Remove any events that fail the preliminary cuts.  Preliminary
cuts used in nucleon decay analysis detailed in water unidoc.

3. Create the fractional sacrifice histogram as a function of
energy.  This sacrifice will be associated with either the data cleaning
bifurcaiton branch cuts (cut1) or the classifiers (cut2).

4. Fit a flat line to the sacrifice distribution.  When fitting, be sure
to have the fit weigh each bin by it's statistical uncertainties.  For example,
if using scipy.optimize.curve_fit to fit the straight line, you want to give 
the array of uncertainties to the "sigma" argument.

In sacrifice_summary.json, the best fit sacrifice is the "sacrifice" value, and
the uncertainty on the fit is the "stat_unc" entry.

5. Calculate the sacrifice histogram's standard deviation from the best fit
line.  This result is the "sys_unc" entry of sacrifice_summary.json.
