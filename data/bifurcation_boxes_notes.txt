##How to calculate the values associated with bifurcation_boxes.json##

The following steps describe how to fill in the bifurcation_boxes.json
file that is read in by the contamination analyzer class.  

1. Get fully processed dataset of interest.  ntuples 
are preferred, as they will be faster to search and have
data cleaning cut information.

2. Count the number of events in your dataset.  This value is the
"allev" entry of bifurcation_boxes.json.

2. Remove any events that fail the preliminary cuts.  Preliminary
cuts used in nucleon decay analysis detailed in water unidoc.  The
remaining number of events is the "pass_path" entry of bifurcation_boxes.json.

3. Loop over the remaining events and check to see if each event fails
or passes the cuts defining the two bifurcation branches "cut1" and "cut2".  
For each event, increment the "a", "b", "c", or "d" entry in 
bifurcation_boxes.json based on matching the following criteria:

A: passes cut 1 (data cleaning), passes cut 2 (classifiers)
C: passes cut 1 (data cleaning), fails cut 2 (classifiers)
B: fails cut 1 (data cleaning), passes cut 2 (classifiers)
D: fails cut 1 (data cleaning), fails cut 2 (classifiers)
